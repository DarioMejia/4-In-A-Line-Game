# 4-In-A-Line-Game
In this strategy game, players slide disks down columns trying to get four in a row â€” up, down, or diagonally. This Java Application was originally created as an assignment for the Data Structures II subject at my university, Universidad del Norte.

# Rules
- Point the cursor over the row button you wish to drop your piece in.
- Left click on the button to drop your piece. (You can also use 1-7 numbers in your keyboard)
- When you can connect four pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally you win.
